# text-based-dungeon-crawler
 This project was made in 2019 as my first python project for my high school class.

 The dungeon crawler takes place in a 5x3 grid with monsters to fight, secrets, and a big bad boss at the end.  Make sure you manage your swords, they are flimsy and break after every fight.  You wouldn't want to be caught without one.
